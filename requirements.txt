# Requirements for running the Caltech‑101 CNN code on Google Colab
#
# This file enumerates only the packages required for the provided
# `cnn_model.py`, `data_loader.py`, `train.py`, and `evaluate.py` scripts.
# It deliberately omits packages that are part of Python’s standard library
# (such as `pathlib`) and avoids installing auxiliary packages like
# `tensorflow-datasets` or the standalone `tensorflow.keras` module because
# they are not used in the refactored code and may conflict with the
# TensorFlow version shipped with Colab.

# Pin TensorFlow to a known‑working version.  Version 2.19.0 is the default
# in current Colab environments and supports Python 3.11–3.12.  A fixed
# version helps avoid ABI and symbol mismatches that can occur if multiple
# TensorFlow‑related packages are upgraded independently.
tensorflow==2.19.0

# Numerical library used throughout the project.  TensorFlow depends on
# NumPy, but we list it explicitly for clarity.  Any version compatible with
# TensorFlow 2.19 (NumPy <2.2) will suffice.
numpy>=1.26,<2.2

# Scikit‑learn is used for computing the F1 score and confusion matrix.
scikit-learn>=1.2

# Matplotlib generates the confusion matrix image.
matplotlib>=3.5

# Tqdm provides a progress bar for iterating over batches.  If you do not
# need progress bars (or are using the refactored code without `tqdm`), you
# can safely omit this dependency.
tqdm>=4.64
